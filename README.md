# Go learning

In this repository I collect notes and exercises to learn Go.

## Context:

* `notes` - A collection of notes about the language
* `todo` - My first Go application, a simple CLI-based TODO application
* `hikeandbite` - A hike route search application for practicing REST application implementation
